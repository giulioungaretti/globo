// ChordAngle represents the angle subtended by a chord (i.e., the straight
// line segment connecting two points on the sphere). Its representation
// makes it very efficient for computing and comparing distances, but unlike
// Angle it is only capable of representing angles between 0 and Ï€ radians.
// Generally, ChordAngle should only be used in loops where many angles need
// to be calculated and compared. Otherwise it is simpler to use Angle.
//
// ChordAngles are represented by the squared chord length, which can
// range from 0 to 4. Positive infinity represents an infinite squared length.
